# Computers-Site-Backend
The backend (node and express) portion of the updated computers site

TODO: add file validation into readInventoryFile() return {} or 0 (something idk)
then in each of the watcher functions, write result of readInventoryFile to a variable, check to make sure it is
not the known bad value.

Current plan is to flesh out this system, and then move on to the refactor.
Flesh out means: make sure crud options are all available and working, add data validation options
-make sure no two items with same serial, make sure database accurately reflects files in case error happens
